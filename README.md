#  Mastodon VA-11 Hall-A Edition  #

Mastodon VA-11 Hall-A Edition is a friendly fork of [Mastodon Glitch Edition](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon) with some changes like:
* Increased image resolution limit (15360x8640px)
* Increased poll options limit (20)
* Lower ruby version according to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS package

So here's the deal: we all work on this code, and then it runs on va11hal.la and anyone who uses that does so absolutely at their own risk. can you dig it?
